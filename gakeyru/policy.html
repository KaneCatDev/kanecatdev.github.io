        <section id="info-we-collect">
            <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>

            <p>
                The App does not require user registration and does not directly request personal data such as name or password.
                However, through your use of the App and third-party services, the following types of information may be collected:
            </p>

            <h3>1.1 Technical and usage data (generally non-directly identifiable)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Device model and manufacturer.</li>
                <li>Android operating system version.</li>
                <li>App version.</li>
                <li>Basic diagnostics data (e.g., app performance, crash information), depending on enabled SDKs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Advertising-related data (Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK)</h3>
            <p>The App displays ads provided by Google AdMob. Ad services may collect and/or process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device identifiers such as the Advertising ID (subject to user/device settings).</li>
                <li>Ad impressions, clicks, and interaction events.</li>
                <li>Approximate location (e.g., country/region), which may be inferred from IP address.</li>
                <li>Diagnostic information (e.g., performance data, error logs) for fraud prevention and ad quality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
                The processing of this data is governed by the relevant third-party privacy policies.
            </p>

            <h3>1.3 Data provided voluntarily by the user (Support email)</h3>
            <p>If you choose to contact the Developer via email, you may provide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your email address (as the sender).</li>
                <li>The subject and content of your message and any information you include.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The App prepares the email via your device’s email client; you review and send it.
                This information is used only to respond to your request and manage support.
            </p>

            <h3>1.4 Direct connections to external APIs (No Developer server)</h3>
            <p>
                The App does not operate any proprietary backend server. Requests for deals and game information are made directly
                from your device to third-party APIs (e.g., CheapShark, Steam, Steam Community). When you use these features,
                those providers may receive:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The request content (e.g., search terms, game identifiers, parameters).</li>
                <li>Technical data necessary to deliver the response (e.g., IP address, user agent, timestamps), as handled by the third-party provider.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="purposes">
            <h2>2. Purposes of processing</h2>
            <p>Information is used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide and operate the App’s core features.</li>
                <li>Retrieve and display video game deals and information.</li>
                <li>Send optional local notifications (if enabled) when new free game deals are detected.</li>
                <li>Display and measure advertising effectiveness.</li>
                <li>Improve stability, performance, and user experience.</li>
                <li>Respond to user support requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Developer does not sell personal data.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section id="third-parties">
            <h2>3. Third-party services and APIs</h2>
            <p>The App may use third-party services and APIs, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads SDK) for advertising.</li>
                <li>CheapShark API to fetch deal information.</li>
                <li>Steam / Steam Community endpoints (where applicable) to fetch game information and reviews.</li>
                <li>Google Play services required for app distribution and related functionality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
                These providers may collect and process information according to their own privacy policies.
                Gakeyru is not affiliated with CheapShark, Steam, Steam Community, or any digital store.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="permissions">
            <h2>4. App permissions</h2>
            <p>The App may request, among others, the following permissions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internet access:</strong> required to retrieve deals/game info and load ads.</li>
                <li><strong>Network state access (if applicable):</strong> used to check connectivity status.</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications (Android 13+):</strong> used to alert you when new free game deals are detected. You can disable notifications at any time in the App settings or in your device settings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The App does not request access to the camera, microphone, contacts, or precise location.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="security">
            <h2>5. Data security</h2>
            <p>
                We use standard security measures and encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) where applicable.
                The Developer does not operate a user account system and does not store personal data on proprietary servers.
                No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="retention">
            <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Advertising and diagnostic data are retained according to the policies and retention periods of third-party providers (e.g., Google).</li>
                <li>Support emails are retained only as long as necessary to handle the communication and, where required, comply with legal obligations.</li>
                <li>The Developer does not store search queries or API responses on proprietary servers (requests are made directly from the device).</li>
                <li>The App may store locally (on-device) a small history of notified deal IDs to avoid sending duplicate notifications (e.g., up to 30 days). This data is not uploaded to the Developer’s servers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="choices">
            <h2>7. Your choices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You can reset or limit the use of your Advertising ID in your device settings.</li>
                <li>You may manage ad personalization settings provided by Google.</li>
                <li>You can disable free-deals notifications in the App settings and/or in your device notification settings.</li>
                <li>
                    If required by law (e.g., EEA/UK/Switzerland), we may request your consent for personalized advertising.
                    If you do not consent, ads may be served in a more limited, non-personalized form.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="rights">
            <h2>8. User rights</h2>
            <p>
                To the extent permitted by applicable law, you may request access to, correction of, or deletion of personal data
                you have voluntarily provided (e.g., support emails). Since the App does not provide user accounts, most requests
                relate to email communications.
